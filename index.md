## Project

Our project, JUNIPER is a proxy interface for that enables individuals and organizations to unlock the vast potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by upholding user or organization privacy. It is applied to medical diagnosis for initial proof of concept, where large quantities of private data are present. Individuals and companies should no longer fear sensitive data leaks and utilize the power of open-source LLMs.

The following sections provide additional detail on the need for our project, as well as explanations of our technical approach to building our product.

### Background

There is a pervasive concern regarding privacy breaches and data exposure when utilizing LLMs-based services. Users may inadvertently divulge sensitive information in their LLM prompts, which is then shared with LLM providers and potentially used elsewhere. Moreover, organizations face stringent regulations, like GDPR, governing the handling of personal data. Additionally, conventional data anonymization methods, aimed at safeguarding privacy, often inadvertently undermine the effectiveness of downstream tasks.  

The application of open-source LLMs in medical diagnosis represents an important initial proof of concept, particularly given the vast amounts of private data involved in healthcare. By leveraging these language models, medical professionals can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, the prospect of utilizing such technologies also raises concerns about the security and privacy of sensitive medical data. Hence, we have Juniper as a proxy interface to prevent any private data from being stored or utilized by LLMs while they work to the best of their efficiency.

#### Levels of Privacy

To effectively filter out private data, it's imperative to establish a clear framework delineating different levels of privacy. Our approach involves categorizing private data into four distinct levels, each accompanied by commonly recognized descriptors. Within these levels, we pinpoint the specific types of data pertinent to our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). For instance, Level 1 encompasses personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Moving up to Level 2, we consider more sensitive data like nationality, political opinions, and religious beliefs. Level 3 focuses on critical personal details like date of birth, while Level 4 is dedicated to safeguarding business secrets, encompassing any proprietary data belonging to organizations that should not be disclosed publicly. This meticulous categorization enables us to precisely identify and filter out sensitive information, ensuring robust privacy protection measures within our system.
